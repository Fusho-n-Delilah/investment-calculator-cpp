I feel my console output formatting was particularly clean with this project. It was very legible and professional. I do think I could have enhanced this code by finding a way to clear the console so that it felt more like a paged web app even in the console. Allowing the loop to feel more like a legitimate program. Overall, I believe my code was clean.

Honestly, this project was completed in a single "flow state" and came together rather seemlessly. I didn't find any one piece particularly challenging. I will take this foundational knowledge of c++ into the future toward late term career goals on larger government projects. I believe my code is clean, segmented well, readable, and reusable. Methods are named appropriate for their function, and they only perform a single function. Inline comments document the code well. Finally, it is a good starting point for a larger investment application for calculating mutual fund investments.
